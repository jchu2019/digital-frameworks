## Gender Inequity in Professional Ballet
From the outside it may seem like women play a prominent role in the ballet world, but the truth is that their career paths are largely limited by men in the industry. Most leadership positions, such as choreographers, directors and boards of trustees, are dominated by men. It's also been reported that women's salaries are not as competitive. In terms of showcasing their work on stage, female choreographers often do not receive the same treatment or opportunities as their male counterparts. How does gender distribution in professional ballet affect its members and the success of a company? What is the gender distribution like in terms of salaries, choreographic work, etc.?

### Critique
#### Clarity and accuracy
* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? 5 
   * What was it? To highlight data about the gender gap in professional ballet from a recent report by the Dance Data Project
   * Was it in the headline? Yes
* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? 4
   * Was that the most efficient way to navigate? I looked at the bolded words and numbers, but the layout of the article was not very visually appealing. The bulletpoint format did not make me want to keep reading.
   * Can you suggest ways to improve navigation? Presenting the data in a table or some sort of graphic would be easier on the eyes. 
* Do you think the data was accurate? 5
   * List sources you would suggest the reporter check with. Dance Data Project
   * Did they provide a source? Yes
   * Did they explain everything that needed explaining? Could have provided some more context about the DDP report and DDP since it is a newly launched website. 
#### Quality
* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? 3
   * Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made. Since the article is very short and mostly numbers, it would have been a better idea to present the data in table form. The reporter could have also included diagrams from the actual report to add some more visual elements. 
#### Creativity
* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? 1

## Alcoholism Among Young Adults
Alcoholism has long been an issue in the U.S. but has the rate of alcoholism changed over the last decade? There has been a lot of focus on the opioid epidemic and and other drug addictions, making it seem like alcoholism has, in some ways, taken a back seat when it comes to media attention. With the recent increase in popularity of health trends and sober parties among young adults, has the prevalence of alcoholism gone down? Or has alcoholism become so normalized among young adults due to things like binge-drinking culture that it is now underdiagnosed?
