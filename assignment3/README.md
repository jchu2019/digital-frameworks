# Assignment 3: Cleaning data 
## The process 

Split names into last_name and first_name columns by using "text to columns" 
Tried to trim leading spaces in "first_name" column, but =TRIM(text) didn't work. Help? 
Deleted "office", "party_full", "district_number" and "incumbent challenge" because there are already columns for those values Aligned all columns to left 
Separated all dates and times, and separated dates into month, day and year columns.
