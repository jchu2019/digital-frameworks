# Assignment 3: Cleaning data 
## The process 

1. Split names into last_name and first_name columns by using "text to columns" 
2. Tried to trim leading spaces in "first_name" column, but =TRIM(text) didn't work. Help? 
3. Deleted "office", "party_full", "district_number" and "incumbent challenge" because there are already columns for those values Aligned all columns to left 
4. Separated all dates and times, and separated dates into month, day and year columns.
