# Effect of race on success of medical marijuana dispensaries in D.C. 

Race has always been a prominent issue when it comes to cannabis, because people of color are the group most targeted and negatively impacted by the war on drugs. In Washington, D.C., 2017 legislation gave preference to minority-owned businesses looking to enter the cannabis industry in an effort to establish racial equity and prevent the industry from becoming a white-dominant space. I wonder how minority-owned medical marijuana dispensaries compare to white-owned dispensaries in the nation's capital in terms of success. Minorities may have a fairer chance now to enter the industry, but are their businesses as successful? 

Here is the data I will be collecting, and an explanation of why:
* The name of the medical marijuana dispensary in D.C. 
* Its location in D.C. (this might be a confounding factor, because some areas may get more foot traffic than others. the neighborhood also plays a role in the amount of people who go to that dispensary) 
* The owner's race (POC or white) 
* If the owner's race is public (if it isn't public, then customers may not know the owner's race and it wouldn't be a factor) 
* The number of stars it received on Yelp (this is how I will be judging the dispensary's "success") 
* How many people rated it on Yelp 

I will collect the data by looking at each dispensary's Yelp rating and information. I will also look at each dispensary's website to see if the owner's race is disclosed in any way. 

Name | Location | Owner's Race | Public | Stars | Raters |

National Holistic Healing Center | Dupont Circle | POC | yes | 5 | 9 |
