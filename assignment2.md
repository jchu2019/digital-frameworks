# Effect of race on success of medical marijuana dispensaries in D.C. 

As more states move to legalize cannabis, legal dispensaries are becoming more common. Race has always been a prominent issue when it comes to cannabis, because people of color are the group most targeted by the war on drugs. 2017 legislation gave preference to minority-owned businesses looking to enter the cannabis industry in an effort to create racial equity and prevent the industry from becoming a white-dominant space. Washington, D.C. only has medical marijuana dispensaries. I wonder how minority-run dispensaries compare to white-run dispensaries in the nation's capital in terms of success. Minorities may have a fairer chance to enter the industry, but are their businesses as successful? 

Here is the data I will be collecting, and an explanation of why:
