# Data Story Pitch
## Josephine Chu 

I plan to analyze the number of presidential candidates running for the Democratic and Republican party. My question is: does the number of candidates running to be their party's presidential nominee affect the outcome of the election? I'm interested to see if a higher number of people vying for the role of nominee means the party is more divided and the opposing party wins the election.

To do this, I will use data from the U.S. Federal Election Commission and the Library of Congress. 

I could visualize the amount of candidates running for either party by making a bar graph (by election year). 

This is timely because we have a whopping number of Democratic candidates in the running for the 2020 presidential election, and some are saying that the large candidate pool may hurt the party's ability to beat Trump. Trump's presidency has been tumultuous, so this upcoming election is very important to Democrats.

For sources, I could talk to political analysts as well as political science and government professors at universities.
